Specific comments on code quality:

Overall very good code I'd say for readibility. The logic is easy to read, the naming conventions are
as expected. The class and method names are pretty descriptive. The if-else chain in the update
method is easy to read and understand, but maybe using something like an array for this could be a
tad cleaner, but its still good as is.

The formatting in this script, along with other scripts you wrote, is pretty consistent as well.

My only concern is is that you have defined a position var in the boss projectile sprite, but don't
use it. Not sure if you want to later on, but if not it's probably best to remove this for now. It
could get confusing if there are more bosses later on.
