Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:

Overall I find this class to be very readable. Variables and methods are aptly named with features that are perfectly described by their names. If I were to offer some critique, I would say that the current way of populating the tiles array is overly verbose and can be greatly simplified. Rather than intializing the list and then calling the Add() method repeatedly, you could do this:
tiles = new List<ISprite> {
	tiles.Add(factory.CreateStatueSprite()),
    tiles.Add(factory.CreateSquareBlockSprite()),
	tiles.Add(factory.CreateBlueGapSprite()),
	...
};
I find this implementation to be far more clear and readable.
