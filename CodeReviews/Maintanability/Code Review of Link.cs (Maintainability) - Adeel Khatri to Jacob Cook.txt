Specific comments on code quality:

I think overall the code is pretty good, its designed pretty well and frankly I initially used it for
the container classes I designed. However, I'd say there are maybe a few areas of improvement that 
might be problematic later on.

I did see ur comment but reiterating, I think the magic numbers for position and speed could be an
issue later on. Setting these as some constant vars at the top of the script might not be a bad idea,
but clearly you have intentions to change this later on.

A small note, and maybe my understanding of the hurt component isn't correct, but I found it strange
that Sprite.Hurt was in the draw method, not update. If its strictly visual right now that seems fine,
but if there's gonna be more functionallity added, wouldn't it be smart to move this to update?

Last point, couldn't the public position of link be an issue when colliders are added? For example, if
other scripts are changing link's position, wouldn't that mean each one would need its own collider 
check? Maybe this is too far into the future, but might be worth noting.
