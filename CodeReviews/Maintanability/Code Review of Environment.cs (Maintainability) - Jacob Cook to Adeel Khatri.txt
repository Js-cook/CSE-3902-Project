Specific comments on code quality: 

Overall methods and variables are very aptly named and simple. Each method has a simple and descriptive name that perfectly describes what it does. If I were to offer some criticism, I would say that the constructor is doing quite a bit of work here by setting position, index, and filling the tiles array. It might help to add some helper methods or even a tile manager to handle all the managing of tile collections like the tiles array. If you wanted to keep going with the current style, the different tiles could be directly added to the array rather than by repeatedly calling the add method.
