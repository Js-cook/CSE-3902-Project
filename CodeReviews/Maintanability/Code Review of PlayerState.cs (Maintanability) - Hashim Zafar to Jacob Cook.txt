Specific comments on code quality: 

The biggest concern in the player state class is the violation of the DRY principle as a lot of the classes are repeated (e.g MovingLeft, MovingRight, DownIdle, UpIdle) with a lot of the differences just being the Sprite that is being called to draw. Advice would be to factor out the common classes and pass the different Sprite as a parameter. 
However, the player state class does not have too many responsibilities, as it only handles the state (e.g left, right, moving, idle) and in it, what sprite method needs to be called from the SpriteFactory? It does not know about movement or input, just the logic of the state it is in. 

A hypothetical change such as adding a new player state (e.g ducking or jumping) would be simple as it will need a new state class to be implemented with most of its code being heavily similar to the other classes with minute changes, and it would call the same name SpriteFactory method classes without needing to reimplement any logic in that end.
