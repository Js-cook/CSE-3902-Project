Sprint 2 Reflection

Overall the team performed rather well on delivering the required amount of functionality for the sprint with a good degree of maintainability and readability. Usage of techniques like sprite factories and state models greatly helped to simplify logic while also providing a cohesive starting point for future sprints/development. I would say, however, that the planning and timing of work could have been drastically improved. As a team, we didn't do a ton of planning and coordination early and so some features took longer to get around to than others. In terms of a burndown chart, it seemed like there was a lot of work done toward the end of the sprint rather than the beginning. In the future, I think it would be worthwhile for the team to sit down and formally plan timelines and what features will be finished by when. By doing this, we would also be able to set aside more time to polish/refactor existing code and perform more careful code reviews.
