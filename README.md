# Sprint 2 - Due 2/23

## Rough Plan
### States
- Use the example in 9-GoombaStateExample.cs
- Interface for state with methods that change the state
- Class for whatever it is (player, enemy, etc) has a public field of the state interface type
- Classes for each state with a private field for the actual thing (player, enemy) that implements the interface
### Sprites
- Use the example in 8-EnemySpriteFactorySingletonExample.cs
- Ideally, this handles animation too
- State classes will likely interface with these the most

## Bugs and Known Issues
- ...

## Metrics
- idk if we need this but if we do we can put a table here
